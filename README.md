# hello-world project

Borrowed from https://jhooq.com/run-quarkus-inside-docker-container/.

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```
./gradlew quarkusDev
```

## Packaging and running the application

The application is packageable using `./gradlew quarkusBuild`.
It produces the executable `hello-world-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar` file in `build` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `build/lib` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar build/hello-world-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, just add the `--uber-jar` option to the command line:
```
./gradlew quarkusBuild --uber-jar
```

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: `./gradlew buildNative`.

Or you can use Docker to build the native executable using: `./gradlew buildNative --docker-build=true`.

You can then execute your binary: `./build/hello-world-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`
